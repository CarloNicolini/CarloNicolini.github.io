  abstract: 'Graph theoretical methods provide a powerful framework to investigate brain connectivity networks and their modular organization. Recently, it has been shown that many graph-based methods suffer from a fundamental resolution limit that may have affected previous studies and prevented detection of modules that are smaller than an intrinsic scale. Optimization of Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function rooted in discrete probability theory,  has revealed a substantially different picture. Indeed, a wide size distribution of modules, or communities, was found in binary networks, thus suggesting that a revision of the current models of the modular organization of brain connectivity may be in order. However, functional connectivity networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain regions. Here, we extend Surprise optimization to the study of weighted networks, and validate this new approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular structure. We compare Surprise with leading community detection methods currently in use and show its improved specificity and sensitivity in the detection of small modules even in the presence of noise and inter-subject variability such as those observed in fMRI experiments. Finally, we apply our novel approach to functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experiments, and demonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of clusters spanning different scales.'

  abstract: 'The modular organization of brain networks has been widely investigated using graph theoretical approaches. Recently, it has been demonstrated that graph partitioning methods based on the maximization of global fitness functions, like Newman’s Modularity, suffer from a resolution limit, as they fail to detect modules that are smaller than a scale determined by the size of the entire network. Here we explore the effects of this limitation on the study of brain connectivity networks. We demonstrate that the resolution limit prevents detection of important details of the brain modular structure, thus hampering the ability to appreciate differences between networks and to assess the topological roles of nodes. We show that Surprise, a recently proposed fitness function based on probability theory, does not suffer from these limitations. Surprise maximization in brain co-activation and functional connectivity resting state networks reveals the presence of a rich structure of heterogeneously distributed modules, and differences in networks’ partitions that are undetectable by resolution-limited methods. Moreover, Surprise leads to a more accurate identification of the network’s connector hubs, the elements that integrate the brain modules into a cohesive structure.'

- title: 'A framework for the study of vision in active observers'
  authors: 'Nicolini C., Fantoni A., Mancuso G., Volcic R., Domini F.'
  journal: 'Proceedings of SPIE, 9014, 901414, San Francisco, California, February 2–6, 2014'
  abstract: 'We present a framework for the study of active vision, i.e., the functioning of the visual system during actively self-generated body movements. In laboratory settings, human vision is usually studied with a static observer looking at static or, at best, dynamic stimuli. In the real world, however, humans constantly move within dynamic environments. The resulting visual inputs are thus an intertwined mixture of self- and externally-generated movements. To fill this gap, we developed a virtual environment integrated with a head-tracking system in which the influence of self- and externally-generated movements can be manipulated independently. As a proof of principle, we studied perceptual stationarity of the visual world during lateral translation or rotation of the head. The movement of the visual stimulus was thus parametrically tethered to self-generated movements. We found that estimates of object stationarity were less biased and more precise during head rotation than translation. In both cases the visual stimulus had to partially follow the head movement to be perceived as immobile. We discuss a range of possibilities for our setup among which the study of shape perception in active and passive conditions, where the same optic flow is replayed to stationary observers.'

- title: 'From on-going to complete activity recognition exploiting related activities'
  authors: 'Nicolini C., Lepri B., Teso S., Passerini A.'
  journal: 'Human Behavior Understanding, First International Workshop, HBU 2010, Istanbul, Turkey, August 22, 2010'
  abstract: 'Activity recognition can be seen as a local task aimed at identifying an on-going activity performed at a certain time, or a global one identifying time segments in which a certain activity is being per- formed. We combine these tasks by a hierarchical approach which locally predicts on-going activities by a Support Vector Machine and globally refines them by a Conditional Random Field focused on time segments in- volving related activities. By varying temporal scales in order to account for widely different activity durations, we achieve substantial improve- ments in on-going activity recognition on a realistic dataset from the PlaceLab sensing environment. When focusing on periods within which related activities are known to be performed, the refinement stage man- ages to exploit these relationships in order to correct inaccurate local predictions.'
