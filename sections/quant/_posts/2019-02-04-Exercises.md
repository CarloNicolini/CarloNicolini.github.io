### Exercise 1
One morning in Springfield, it started snowing at heavy but constant rate. Homer Simpson had just started his own snowplow business. His snowplot started out at 08:00 AM and at 09:00 AM it had gone 2 miles. By 10:00 AM it had gone 3 miles.
Assuming that the snowplow removes a constant volume of snow per hour, determine the time at which it started snowing.

#### Solution


### Exercise 2
$a$ and $b$ are randomly chosen real numbers in the interval $[0,1]$,
that is both $a$ and $b$ are standard uniform random variables.
Find the probability that the quadratic equation $x^2+ax+b= 0$ has real solutions.

### Solution
The equation $x^2 + ax + b=0$ has real solutions if its determinant is positive or zero.
The determinant of a second order equation $ax^2 + bx + c=0$ is found as $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$.
So in our case we have $\Delta = a^2 - 4b$. We know that both $a$ and $b$ are $\sim U[0,1]$.
Here then we must compute the probability that $a^2-4b \geq 0$, i.e. $P(a^2-4b \geq 0)$.


#### Exercise 3
Solve the equation

\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\sqrt{x}+{\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{x}...} =x
\end{equation}
