### Exercise 1
One morning in Springfield, it started snowing at heavy but constant rate. Homer Simpson had just started his own snowplow business. His snowplot started out at 08:00 AM and at 09:00 AM it had gone 2 miles. By 10:00 AM it had gone 3 miles.
Assuming that the snowplow removes a constant volume of snow per hour, determine the time at which it started snowing.

#### Solution
