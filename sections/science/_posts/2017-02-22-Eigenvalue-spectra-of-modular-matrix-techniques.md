How to compute spectra of Laplacian of a block matrix
</blockquote>

Network with $$N$$ nodes, 2 blocks of size $$n_A$$ non connected by any link.
Remember that 
$$\det( \mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I})=0$$

is like 
$$ \det( \mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I}) \det(\mathbf{A} + \lambda \mathbf{I}) = 0$$
where $$\mathbf{A}$$ is the submatrix with $$n_a$$ nodes.
