Here is a list of the properties of the trace of a matrix.

The trace is a linear operator
- $$\tr(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B}) = \tr(\mathbf{A}) + \tr(\mathbf{B})$$
- $$\tr(\alpha  \mathbf{A}) = \alpha \tr(\mathbf{A})$$ where $$\alpha$$ is a scalar.
- The trace is equal to the sum of eigenvalues $$\tr(\mathbf{A}) = \sum \limits_i^n \lambda_i(\mathbf{A})$$
