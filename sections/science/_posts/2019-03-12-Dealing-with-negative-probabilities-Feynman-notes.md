Sometimes one needs to relax some implicit assumptions when the results of a theory, which can be logically rigorous, are in stark contrast with the observations.
This is the provocative idea of Richard Feynamn: allow probability taking negative values.
Here I put a transcript of the notes by Prof. Feynman, which are available at [https://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf](https://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf)
