In these notes, we'll take a look at the bare essentials of modern probability theory.
We'll describe the basic ideas, but we will skip Lebesgue integration, at the moment.

### Introduction

Any proper introduction to probability theory has to deal with **measure theory**.

To motivate why we need measure theory, suppose we have a solid ball, filled in 3D space.
A couple of clever guys in 1980, showed that you can cut this ball into small pieces, and by performing only rigid transformations, we can rearrange the pieces of the ball, into two solid balls of both the same surface and volume of the original ball.
This is called the Banach-Tarski paradox.

Stefan Banach and Albert Tarski proved this strange paradox, only using the Zermelo-Frank axioms of mathematics, which are some of the basic fundamentas in math.
Apparently, something must be wrong.
There are two ways to handle this apparent paradox:

1. Reject the axiom of choice. It is very hard to reject, as it is a very simple axiom.
2. Accept the possibility of non-measurable sets. This is a simpler to accept thing.

Apparently, the path to resolve the paradox is to assume that ball is not measurable, hence it makes no sense to say that the measure of the set of tiny objects that make the ball, is not measurable.
The set cannot be assigned a measure in any meaningful way.

Hence, there is a concept underlying what is a measurable set that we need to better specify.
So, in the next lines we need to define what is a *measurable set* and what is a *measure*.

## Meaure theory

**Definition 1**: The power-set of the set $\Omega$ is the set of all subsets of $\Omega$, and is indicated as $2^\Omega$.

**Definition 2**: Given a set $\Omega$, a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ is a collection $A \subset 2^{\Omega}$ such that, $A$ is non empty, and  the following conditions hold:
1. $A$ is closed under complements: this means that if $E\in A$ then $E^c  \in A$.
2. $A$ is closed under countable unions: this means that  the  union of all subsets in $E\in A$, still is a set in $A$.

*Remark 1* The set $\Omega$ itself is always a member of every $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$. This happens since $R \in A$ then $E^c \in A$, hence $E \bigcup E^c \in A$ (by property 1.) and this union is simpliy $\Omega$ itself, by property 2.

*Remark 2* The empty set is always in the $\sigma$-algebra $A$.


*Remark 3* Any $\sigma$-algebra $A$ is closed under countable intersections. Remember that conditions 2 tells us that $\Omega$ is closed under countable unions. By this property we also have closeness under countable intersections.
We can say this because any set is equal to the complement of its complement, and by De Morgan's law, the interesection of the complements, equals the complement of the unions:

$$
\bigcap (E_i^c)^c = \bigcup (E_i^c)^c \in A
$$
and this proves that $A$ is closed under countable interesections.

**Definition 3** Given a set $C \in 2^\Omega$, the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $C$, indicated by $\sigma(C)$, is the smalles $\sigma$-algebera containing $C$.
That is, $\sigma(C) = \limits_{A \supset C}\bigcap A$.

We can prove that $\sigma(C)$ exists because:
1. $2^\Omega$ is a $\sigma$ algebra
2. Any intersection of $\sigma$ algebras is a $\sigma$-algebra. 

### Examples of $\sigma$-algebras

These are $\sigma$-algebras:
1. The trivial $\sigma$-algebra is the empty set $A=\{ \emptyset, \Omega \}$
2. $A=\{ \emptyset, E,E^c,\Omega \}$
3. If $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$, the Borel $\sigma$ algebra $\mathbb{B}(\tau)$ is the $\sigma$ algebra generated by the set of all the open sets in $\mathbb{R}$, denoted by $\tau$.

**Definition 4** A measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ with $\sigma$-algebra $A$ is a function $\mu$ from $A$ to numbers from $0$ to $\infty$ such that two conditions holds:
1. The measure evaluated on the empty set must be zero $\mu(\emptyset)=0$
2. The measure evaluated on the union of the sets, must be the sum of the measure evaluated on each set
$$
\mu \left( \limits_{i=1}^{\infty} \bigcup E_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_i)
$$

**Definition 5** A probability measure, is a measure $P$ with the condition that $P(\Omega)=1$. This is called the normalization condition over the universe set.

These last two definitions, are also called the *Kolmogorov* axioms, the mathematician that posed on theoretical roots probability.
Kolmogorov put probability theory on a firm mathematical grounds.

**Example 2** Let us take a finite set $\Omega$ to be the set of numbers from 1 to $n$: $\Omega= \{1,\ldots, n \}$.
Then we define $P(k)=\frac{1}{n}$ $\forall k \in \Omega$. This defines the measure of the set $\Omega$.
This is called the *uniform* distribution on the set $\Omega$. Defining on $\Omega$ makes possible to induce a measure also on the powerset $A=2^\Omega$.

For example by countable additivity, the set $P(\{1,2,4\})$ can be written as the sum $P(\{1 \} \cup \{2\} \cup \{4\})=P(1) + P(2) + P(4)$, and this defines the probability of our set.

**Example 3** Let us consider countably infinite sets. We take the natural numbers $\Omega=\mathbb{N}$ and the $\sigma$ algebra to be the powerset $A=2^\Omega$.
Consider the probability $P(k)$ that it takes $k$ coin-flips to get heads. This can be computed for a fair coin as:

$$
P(k)= \alpha(1-\alpha)^{k-1} = \frac{1}{2}(1-\frac{1}{2})^{k-1}
$$

This is called the geometric distribution, and every set in the $\sigma$-algebra $A$ uniquely defines a probability measure on $A$.

**Example 4** Let us consider an uncountable set $\Omega = [0, \infty )$. The Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathbb{B}([0,\infty))$ is the $\sigma$ algebra generated by all open intervals in $[0,\infty)$.
We define a probability measure $P([0,x)) = 1-e^{-x}$ $\forall x >0$.
In fact sets of the form $[0,x)$ and definining a probability measure uniquely induces a probability measure on the whole $\sigma$ algebra. This distribution is called the *exponential* distribution.
