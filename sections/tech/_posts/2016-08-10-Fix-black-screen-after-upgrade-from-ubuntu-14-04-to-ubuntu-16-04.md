I've just decided to upgrade my Ubuntu 14.04.4 to the latest Ubuntu distribution 16.04.1. To do this I've followed the instructions and after the installation  rebooted my computer.

At the boot time I've got a black screen with the computer totally frozen and no possibility to use the keyboard.

So I then googled my problem and rebooted keeping pressed the `Shift` key.
