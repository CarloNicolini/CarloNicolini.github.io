# [Introduction to matrix econometrics]()

One can write 

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \ldots \beta_p x_{pi} + \epsilon_i
$$

this can be written in matrix terms as 

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Y} = \boldsymbol \mathbf{X}\beta  + \boldsymbol \epsilon
\end{equation}
$$

where $$\mathbf{Y}$$ is a $$n \times 1$$ column  vector, $$\mathbf{X}$$ is a $$n \times p$$ matrix and $$\boldsymbol \beta$$ is another $$n \times 1$$ column vector.

# [How to differentiate with respect to a vector]()
In order to find the OLS we have to differentiate with respect to $$\beta$$ but now $$\boldsymbol \beta$$ is a vector.
