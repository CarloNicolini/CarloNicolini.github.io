#### 2014-today: PhD student, University of Verona/Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia

I’m currently involved in developing new computational methods for the analysis of modular structure of brain functional connectivity networks with the tools of complex network theory. I'm carrying out my research currently at the BrainetLab of Angelo Bifone, in the CNCS, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. <brainetlab.github.io>


#### 2011 Software consultant at Brown University (USA)

I’ve developed, tested and installed a full system for active vision at the cognitive neuroscience department of Brown University, Providence (RI), USA <http://bit.ly/IoyXV2>.


#### 2010–today Scientific programmer at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

I’m currently working as the main developer of the C++ and Matlab/Psychtoolbox codebase for cognitive neuroscience experiments at
the CNCS@IIT research group. I have expertise in big C++ projects development and maintenance as well as robust foundations in algorithms, numerical analysis, matrix computation and data structures. The code I’ve developed is used in different vision research paper.


#### 2008-2010 Research fellow on Machine learning and intelligent optimization

I’ve worked on human activity recognition with statistical pattern recognition tools such as SVMs, ANNs, and probabilistic graphical models (HMMs and LCRFs). I’ve experience in machine learning and numerical optimization <http://bit.ly/IokSWd>.
