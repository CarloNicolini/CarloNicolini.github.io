### Experience

- **Now (2017-2018): Postdoctoral fellow**

I'm currently involved in developing new computational methods for the analysis of modular structure of brain functional connectivity networks with the tools of quantum information, information theory and complex networks theory.
I'm carrying out my research currently at the BrainetLab of Angelo Bifone, in the CNCS, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.
I am the developer of the **networkqit** package, a Python package to do computations in the framework of spectral entropies of complex networks.

- **Spring-Summer 2017**

Visiting researcher at Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leiden, The Netherlands.
Working on random matrix theory, generative models of human brain connectivity and community detection, under the guidance of Prof. Diego Garlaschelli.

- **2012-2017 System administrator for high performance computing**

Maintainance of a small computational cluster, experience in high performance computing, parallel computing (Matlab parallel computing toolbox) and CUDA parallel capabilities.

- **2011 Software consultant at Brown University (USA)**

Development, testing and installation a full virtual reality system at the cognitive neuroscience department of Brown University, Providence (RI), USA <http://bit.ly/IoyXV2>.

- **2010â€“2017 Scientific programmer at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia**

Working as the main developer of the C++ and Matlab/Psychtoolbox codebase for cognitive neuroscience experiments at the CNCS@IIT research group. Expertise in big C++ projects development and maintenance as well as robust foundations in algorithms, numerical analysis, matrix computation and data structures.


- **2008-2010 Research fellow on Machine learning and intelligent optimization**

Working on human activity recognition with statistical pattern recognition tools such as SVMs, ANNs, and probabilistic graphical models (HMMs and LCRFs). Experience in machine learning and numerical optimization <http://bit.ly/IokSWd>.
