### Experience

* April-May 2018 Freelance software consultant*
Adaptation of the GraphInsight package for stereo visualization and head tracking for the Mechdyne company.

* Now (2017-2018)*
I'm currently involved in developing new computational methods for the analysis of modular structure of brain functional connectivity networks with the tools of quantum information, information theory and complex networks theory.
I'm carrying out my research currently at the BrainetLab of Angelo Bifone, in the CNCS, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.
I am the developer of the **networkqit** package, a Python package to do computations in the framework of spectral entropies of complex networks.

*Spring-Summer 2017*

Visiting researcher at Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leiden, The Netherlands.
Working on random matrix theory, generative models of human brain connectivity and community detection, under the guidance of Prof. Diego Garlaschelli.

*2012-2017 System administrator for high performance computing*
Currently maintaining a small computational cluster, with experience in high performance computing, parallel computing (Matlab parallel computing toolbox) and CUDA parallel capabilities.

*2011 Software consultant at Brown University (USA)*

I’ve developed, tested and installed a full system for active vision at the cognitive neuroscience department of Brown University, Providence (RI), USA <http://bit.ly/IoyXV2>.

*2010–2017 Scientific programmer at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia*

I’m currently working as the main developer of the C++ and Matlab/Psychtoolbox codebase for cognitive neuroscience experiments at
the CNCS@IIT research group. I have expertise in big C++ projects development and maintenance as well as robust foundations in algorithms, numerical analysis, matrix computation and data structures. The code I’ve developed is used in different vision research paper.


*2008-2010 Research fellow on Machine learning and intelligent optimization*

I've worked on human activity recognition with statistical pattern recognition tools such as SVMs, ANNs, and probabilistic graphical models (HMMs and LCRFs). I’ve experience in machine learning and numerical optimization <http://bit.ly/IokSWd>.
